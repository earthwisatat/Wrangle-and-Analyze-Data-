# Wrangle and Analyze Data
### Data Analyst Nanodegree Project


Data wrangling is a core skill that everyone who works with data should be familiar with since so much of the world's data is not clean. Using Python and its libraries, I had to gather, assess, and clean the data, for it to be used for analysis and visualization. It is a process divided into 3 main steps:
- Gathering.
- Assessing.
- Cleaning. 


## Gathering
The data for this project was in three different formats and they were obtained as mentioned:
1. From WeRateDogs Twitter archive given by Udacity in csv format.
2. Image prediction file downloaded programmatically using Requests library and the URL provided by Udacity in tsv format.
3. Data retrieved by querying Twitter's APIs and using Tweepy library (I may use the provided tweet_json.txt in this project instead of the twitter api). 


## Assessing
After gathering the data and storing them in DataFrames, thetables were saved and assessed visually and programmatically. The following step was assessing the data for quality and tidiness. Data were assessed programmatically and visually.


## Cleaning
It was divided in three parts as per the data sets and was further divided as per the three steps, define, code and test. These steps were used in the cleaning process. First, copies of the DataFrames were created before cleaning. Then, the steps of cleaning were applied iteratively on all issues.


## Analysis & Visualization
These steps are not part of data wrangling process. However, it cannot reflect correct and accurate insights without performing data wrangling first. Visualizations and insights are provided in â€˜act_report.pdf

## Conclusion
Data wrangling is one of the key skills in analyzing, debugging, and cleaning up data for easy analysis.
I have practiced this skill with the Python library which is one of the most powerful analytical tools, and this skill can be applied in many fields, not only for data analysis.
